# Welcome To Lecture0!
# By this time, you should have already installed Python, VS Code and Git/Github Desktop!
# We will being writing Python in this file shortly! Stay tuned! 
# You may have noticed #'s in front of the first few lines - these are intentinal.
# Whatever we write in this file will be interpreted by Python when we execute 
# this file. As such, if we want to write in English (in full sentences), 
# we use #'s. This is tells Python to treat this line as a comment, which is useful for 
# human eyes. Python will ignore these # lines and will not execute them - perfect for wiritng notes! 


# Lets say hello to the world! 

print("Hello World!")
# your_name = input("What is your name? ")

# There are more ways than one to accomplish the same thing...
# We will disucss f" later, take aquick peek now! 
#print("\nHello " + your_name + "! Welcome to coding in Python!")
#print(f"Hello {your_name}! Welcome to coding in Python!\n")
